# Assignment

## Purpose

A primary goal of this project is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- **Be respectful:** Value each otherâ€™s ideas, styles, and viewpoints. Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be kind in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people.
- **Be direct but professional:** We value direct communication, but it must be done respectfully. Disparaging remarks, personal attacks, and inflammatory language do not foster a positive and productive environment.
- **Be inclusive:** Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and opinions is an asset, and we want everyone to feel comfortable in contributing their ideas and feedback.
- **Be empathetic and patient:** We all come from different backgrounds and have different levels of experience. If someone asks for help or guidance, be patient and considerate in your response.
- **Be collaborative:** Work together effectively. Collaboration makes us stronger as a community. Share your skills, knowledge, and experience freely.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- **Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.**
- **Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.**
- **Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.**
- **Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.**
- **Inappropriate photography or recording.**
- **Unwelcome sexual attention.**
- **Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in person).**
- **Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.**

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a project maintainer as soon as possible. You can contact us via [email/other contact method] [insert contact details].

## Consequences

We will not tolerate unacceptable behavior from any community member. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the project and community without warning.
